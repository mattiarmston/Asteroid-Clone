Survive as long as you can in this asteroid-inspired retro game. Dodge asteroids
and collect fuel cans to keep your space ship in running order as long as you
can.

## Installation

1. Ensure pygame is installed, if not run: `pip install pygame`
2. Clone the repository

4. To play, run: `python3 __main__.py`

## How to play

Use WASD or the Arrow Keys to move and navigate the menu. Try to avoid the grey
asteroids for as long as you can â€“ but be careful! You only have 10 seconds of
fuel, which you can replenish by flying into and collecting fuel cans, which are
scattered across the screen. Try to survive as long as you can and beat your
high score.
